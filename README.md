# vpn-connection-checker
VPN Connection Checker is a Windows Forms application written in C# using .NET 8.0. This application monitors your network interfaces and visually indicates whether you are connected to a VPN. The background color of the application changes to green if a VPN is detected, and red if no VPN connection is found.

For work, I often have to switch between servers in different countries, and I often forget whether I have turned on the VPN or not. So, I wrote this program, placed it on the monitor, and now I can always see whether I am connected to the VPN or not.
## Features
* Real-time VPN Detection: The application checks for VPN connections every second.
* Visual Indicator: The background color changes based on VPN status. Green: VPN is enabled. Red: VPN is disabled.
* Always on Top: The application window stays on top of all other windows for immediate visibility.
